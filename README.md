There is an urgent need to identify and block abusive or obscene media (images, audio, and video) at the user's endâ€”especially as such content continues to spread rapidly across digital platforms. Traditional content moderation is often server-side and delayed, making it ineffective in real-time prevention. Furthermore, users lack tools to take immediate action or report such content.

Key Requirements are :
1. Detect abusive or explicit images, videos, or audio content in real-time.
2. Block or blur the detected media at the user's end.
3. Notify a central/nodal agency with details such as URL, timestamp, and media type.
4. User consent and manual reporting should be part of the solution to reduce false positives.

Solution consists of :
1. Detection Engine
2. Local Media Scanning
3. User Interaction & Reporting
4.  Privacy Considerations
